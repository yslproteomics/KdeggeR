\title{Plot protein-level value distribution per sample}
\usage{
plotDistributionProtein(o, c = "lightyellow", method = "RIA")
}
\arguments{
\item{o}{A `pSILAC` object. The function expects:
\itemize{
  \item A data slot defined by `method` (`o$RIA`, `o$hol`, or `o$NLI`) as a
        matrix or data frame with precursors (peptides) in rows and samples
        in columns.
  \item `o$peptides` as a data frame containing at least the columns
        `peptide` and `protein` for mapping precursors to proteins.
}}

\item{c}{Character string specifying the fill color of the boxplots. Defaults to
`"lightyellow"`.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying which data slot to plot. Must be one of
`"RIA"`, `"hol"`, or `"NLI"`. Defaults to `"RIA"`.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object showing the distribution of protein-level values per sample
(boxplots) for the selected `method`.
}
\description{
Aggregates precursor-level values (RIA, HoL, or NLI) to the protein level by
taking the median across peptides per protein and sample, and creates boxplots
of the resulting protein-level values for each sample. This helps assess the
distribution and spread of protein-level values across samples.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
  \item Extracts `o$RIA`, `o$hol`, or `o$NLI` depending on `method`.
  \item Joins the selected matrix (rows = peptides) with `o$peptides` to map
        each row to a protein.
  \item For each protein and sample, computes the median value across all
        peptides assigned to that protein (ignoring `NA`s).
  \item Reshapes the resulting protein-by-sample matrix into long format,
        removes `NA`s, and creates one boxplot per sample/column.
  \item If `method = "NLI"`, log2-transforms values prior to plotting.
}

RIA and HoL values are plotted on their original scale. NLI values are plotted
on the log2 scale. Outliers are shown as open circles. If all aggregated
protein-level values are missing, the function returns an empty plot with
labels and issues a warning.

\dontrun{
  plotDistributionProtein(ps)                 # default: RIA
  plotDistributionProtein(ps, method = "hol")
  plotDistributionProtein(ps, method = "NLI")

  # Custom color:
  plotDistributionProtein(ps, c = "gold", method = "RIA")
