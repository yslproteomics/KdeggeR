\title{Calculate H/L-based k_loss}
\usage{
getHoLmod(x, y, tryRobust = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of time points.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of ln(H/L + 1) values corresponding to the time points in `x`.}

\item{tryRobust}{Logical; if `TRUE`, attempts to fit a robust linear model (requires the `MASS` package). Ignored if fewer than 10 data points are available.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 5 containing:
  \itemize{
    \item The k_loss, calculated as the slope of ln(H/L + 1) over time.
    \item The standard error of the slope.
    \item The sum of squared residuals from the linear model.
    \item The R-squared value of the fit.
    \item The number of data points used to build the model.
  }
}
\description{
This function models the rate of loss of the light isotope (k_loss) by fitting a linear model to the log-transformed isotope ratio (ln(H/L + 1)) over specified time points.
Optionally, a robust linear model can be used if there are at least 10 data points.
}
\details{
The function first removes any missing values from `y` and their corresponding time points in `x`.
If only one data point remains, the function returns the ratio of `y` to `x` if `x` equals zero, otherwise returning `NA` values for the slope and associated statistics.
For datasets with at least 10 data points and `tryRobust = TRUE`, a robust linear model is attempted, falling back to a standard linear model if the robust fit fails.
