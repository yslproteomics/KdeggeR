\title{Example design table for a pSILAC dataset analyzed with Spectronaut (replicate design)}
\format{
A data frame defining sample, replicate, condition, and labeling time-point
mappings for Spectronaut-derived pSILAC data.
}
\usage{
example_spectronaut_design_replicates
}
\description{
An example design table used for pSILAC data analysis with replicate
aggregation. Replicate numbers must be explicitly specified, and replicate
grouping must be encoded consistently in the sample identifiers.
}
\details{
When using replicate aggregation, the replicate structure must be reflected
in the \code{sample} column to ensure correct grouping during analysis.
