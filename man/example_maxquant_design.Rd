suitable for pSILAC analysis with replicate aggregation.

\description{
An example design table used for pSILAC data analysis with replicate
aggregation. The table corresponds to a publicly available dataset
(ProteomeXchange accession PXD057850) reported by Frankenfield et al.,
*Molecular & Cellular Proteomics* (2025),
"Benchmarking SILAC Proteomics Workflows and Data Analysis Platforms"
(PMID: 40315959).

The design table is compatible with MaxQuant output generated from
the \code{MaxQuant_dSILAC_CurveFitting.zip} results folder
(derived from the \code{peptides.txt} file).

The experiment consists of a single condition measured at four time
points, each with four biological replicates.
