\title{Plot binned peptide-level R2 as 100 percent stacked bars per sample (HoL only)}
\usage{
plotQCkLossPeptideR2Binned(o)
}
\arguments{
\item{o}{A `pSILAC` object. The function expects `o$hol.kloss` to contain peptide-level
R2 values in columns ending with `.R_squared`.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object showing per-sample proportions of binned R2 (100 percent stacked bars).
}
\description{
Creates a 100 percent stacked bar plot showing, for each sample, the proportion of
peptides falling into R2 quality bins. This is useful when R2 values are
concentrated near 1 (e.g., median ~0.95) and differences are mainly in the tails.
