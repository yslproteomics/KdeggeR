\title{Plot number of valid protein values per sample}
\usage{
plotValidValuesProtein(o, c = "lightyellow", method = "RIA")
}
\arguments{
\item{o}{A `pSILAC` object. The function expects:
\itemize{
  \item A data slot defined by `method` (`o$RIA`, `o$hol`, or `o$NLI`)
        as a matrix or data frame with peptides/precursors in rows and
        samples in columns.
  \item `o$peptides` as a data frame containing at least the columns
        `peptide` and `protein` to map rows to protein groups.
}}

\item{c}{Character string specifying the fill color of the bars. Defaults to
`"lightyellow"`.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying which data slot to use. Must be one of
`"RIA"`, `"hol"`, or `"NLI"`. Defaults to `"RIA"`.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object showing the number of proteins with valid values per sample
(bar chart) for the selected `method`.
}
\description{
Aggregates precursor-level values (RIA, HoL, or NLI) to the protein level by
taking the median across peptides per protein and sample. It then creates a
bar plot showing, for each sample, how many proteins have at least one
quantified (non-missing) value.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
  \item Joins the selected matrix with `o$peptides` to map peptides to proteins.
  \item Aggregates to protein level by computing the median across peptides
        for each protein and sample (`na.rm = TRUE`).
  \item Reshapes the protein-by-sample matrix into long format and removes `NA` values.
  \item Computes, for each sample, the number of proteins with a valid value
        (`count`) and the median of log2-transformed values (`median`) for
        summary purposes.
}

Only `count` is visualized (one bar per sample). If all protein-level values
are missing, the function returns an empty plot with labels and issues a warning.
