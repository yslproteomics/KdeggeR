\title{Filter pSILAC data based on a permissive monotone trend}
\usage{
.filterMonotonePermissive(o, skip_time_point = 0L, min_points = 3L)
}
\arguments{
\item{o}{A `pSILAC` object containing the data to be filtered.}

\item{skip_time_point}{Integer. Number of earliest time points to **exclude**
from monotone filtering. Default = 0 (all time points are checked).}

\item{min_points}{Integer. Minimal number of valid (non-`NA`) values
required per series after filtering; series with fewer points are set to
`NA`. Default is 3.}
}
\value{
The modified `pSILAC` object with filtered data frames `RIA`, `hol`,
  `NLI`, and `NCS`, maintaining the original column order.
}
\description{
Applies a more permissive monotone trend filter to all pSILAC labeling
series in a `pSILAC` object. The filter starts from the last time point
(assumed most accurate) and walks backwards in time, replacing violations
of the expected monotone trend with `NA`. After filtering, series with
fewer than `min_points` valid values are fully discarded (set to `NA`).
